# Miguel File Manager (provisional / temporary name)

## Introduction

Miguel File Manager is file manager, coded with web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</br>
It works thanks to Tauri, a framework that allow to build native apps with these technologies using Rust Lang as backend

> Miguel File Manager born with the goal of learn more about how is possible to use web technologies along with the native OS.</br>
> Personally, its look like something amazing and I would like know how it works in depth

Anyway, despite Miguel File Manager is an experimental project, I will publish it on the AUR repository for Arch based systems,</br>
also I will put build instructions to build on other systems like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc... while I learn how to publish packages of these distros repositories

## Considerations

- Keep in mind that this is an Experimental Project, very much bugs can occur, is the first time that I build a application like this.

- The performance can be very low occasionally due to a not polished build.

- The design can reach to see a little ugly, anyway in the future an option to customize some design part will be available using CSS
